These workflows and notebooks enable scientists with varying computational experience, from first time programmers to experienced coders, to perform GWA analyses in the cloud. The tools span a typical GWA analysis, from file conversion to association testing to summary figure generation. Written in the Workflow Description Language (WDL) with accompanying Docker images, each workflow can be deployed through most major cloud providers, as well as locally or on a high performance compute cluster.\nTry out the tools  To get started, head over to the featured workspace on the Terra platform for a tutorial. This workspace was developed and presented at the 2019 American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Houston, TX. It is the product of a collaboration between the Manning Lab and the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute. Special thanks to Dr. Alisa Manning, Allie Hajian, and Geraldine Van der Auwera.\nAccess the workflows  Each workflow is hosted on the Dockstore platform and available for download or export to multiple cloud computing infrustructures. Access each below:\n File conversion: the vcfToGds workflow will convert variant call format (VCF) files to genomic data structure (GDS) format. GDS format is required to utilize the association testing and LD calculation workflows. Association testing: the genesis_GWAS workflow can be used for single- and multi-variant association testing using the GENESIS software package. Linkage disequalibrium: the LDGds workflow is used to generate linkage disequalibrium measures from genotype data.

Part of its genetic basis may reside among the rare (minor allele frequency 2=53% (P=4.2×10−5) to the genetic component of risk in the largest (European) ancestry subset. We coupled sequence variation with islet epigenomic signatures3 to annotate and group rare variants with respect to gene expression4, chromatin state5 and three-dimensional chromatin architecture6, and show that pancreatic islet regulatory elements contribute to T2D genetic risk (h2=8%, P=2.4×10−3). We used islet annotation to create a non-coding framework for rare variant aggregation testing. This approach identified five loci containing rare alleles in islet regulatory elements that suggest novel biological mechanisms readily linked to hypotheses about variant-to-function. Large scale whole genome sequence analysis reveals the substantial contribution of rare, non-coding variation to the genetic architecture of T2D and highlights the value of tissue-specific regulatory annotation for variant-to-function discovery.","tags":[],"title":"Rare Non-coding Variation Identified by Large Scale Whole Genome Sequencing Reveals Unexplained Heritability of Type 2 Diabetes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tim Majarian"],"categories":[],"content":"Overview Within influenza virus infected cells, viral genomic RNA are selectively packed into progeny virions, which predominantly contain a single copy of 8 viral RNA segments.
